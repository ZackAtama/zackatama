## Work Experience
### Technical Experience;
üöÄ My journey as a Software Developer has been marked by unwavering dedication, a hunger for innovation, and a heartfelt commitment to empowering others. As I continue to shape the future of technology, I look forward to embarking on new adventures, collaborating with fellow trailblazers, and leaving an indelible mark on the ever-evolving landscape of software development.

üõ†Ô∏è My technical prowess encompasses a diverse set of tools and technologies. I excel in the MERN stack, harnessing the power of MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS to create robust and dynamic web applications. I also possess a strong command over backend development using Python, leveraging the capabilities of the Django REST Framework to build scalable and efficient APIs.

### üìöEducator Experience;
I am honoured to serve as a Software Engineering Mentor with Springboard, a renowned online platform that connects learners with industry experts. Sharing my insights and knowledge in software engineering, I help budding developers navigate the complexities of the field and provide them with the guidance they need to succeed.

A significant part of my journey has been with Code First Girls, a noble nonprofit organisation headquartered in the U.K. I hold the esteemed position of Lead Instructor, where I design and deliver cutting-edge coding courses to empower young women with the skills to thrive in the digital age. Guiding these bright minds through the intricacies of coding has been both a rewarding and transformative experience.

As a dedicated educator, I've had the privilege of contributing to the growth of aspiring developers through my roles at esteemed organisations. I proudly served as a Code and Admissions Reviewer at CoGrammar, a prominent Bootcamp platform based in the vibrant tech ecosystem of South Africa. My expertise in assessing code quality and guiding students through the admissions process played a pivotal role in shaping future talents.
